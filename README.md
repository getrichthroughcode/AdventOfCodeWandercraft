## 🧩 Problem Coverage

| Day    | Part One                              | Part Two                              |
|--------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Day 1  | Distance calculation between two lists | Similarity score computation           |
| Day 2  | Safe reports detection                 | Handling the Problem Dampener to allow a bad level |
| Day 3  | Sum of valid multiplications in corrupted memory | Handling conditional enabling/disabling of multiplications (`do()` / `don't()`) |
| Day 4  | Counting `"XMAS"` word occurrences in all directions | Detecting `"X-MAS"` patterns shaped as an X in the grid |
